# Li, Gao, and Du 2022. Stochastic Kriging-Assisted Simulation with Random Covariates. 

This project compares the random design with the adaptive procedures. Each folder contains the scripts for different test examples and adaptive procedures. The introduction to the contents of each folder is as follows.

*   “comparison with hetGP package”: comparing the random design with **hetGP** package (in Binois et al. 2019),
*   “d1”:  comparing the random design with the **Adaptive MSE procedure** in the **one**\-dimensional benchmark function examples,
*   “d2”:  comparing the random design with the **Adaptive MSE procedure** in the **two**\-dimensional benchmark function examples,
*   “d3”:  comparing the random design with the **Adaptive MSE procedure** in the **three**\-dimensional benchmark function examples,
*   “d10”: comparing the random design with the **Adaptive MSE procedure** in the **ten**\-dimensional benchmark function examples.
