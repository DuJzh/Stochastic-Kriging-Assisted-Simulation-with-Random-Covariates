"queue" folder contains the scripts for the M/M/1 queue example;

folders that contain the scripts for the benchmark function examples:
"d1" corresponds to the one-dimensional cases,
"d2" corresponds to the two-dimensional cases,
"d3" corresponds to the three-dimensional cases,
"d10" corresponds to the ten-dimensional cases.
